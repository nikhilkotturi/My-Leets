# merge sorted array

**Problem Number:** 88

**Difficulty:** Easy

**LeetCode URL:** [merge sorted array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

## Problem Description

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n ele...
